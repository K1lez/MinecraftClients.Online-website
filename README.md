# MinecraftClients.Online-website
The source code to https://www.minecraftclients.online/

I publicized the source code of my website incase anyone wants to learn from it.
It isn't the most cleanest and most optimal code, but it works.

If you want to add/manage the clients, goto the [src/js/clients.js](https://github.com/K1lez/MinecraftClients.Online-website/blob/main/src/js/clients.js) and add it to the json.

Anyways, enjoy!
